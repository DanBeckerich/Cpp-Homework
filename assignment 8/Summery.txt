The program begins by creating an array with NUMCOUNT number of numbers in it, in the range of LOW_RANGE and HIGH_RANGE.

while the numbers are created, it populates a vactor with the same dataset.

the program passes the array into the bubble sort method. Bubble sort has a time complecity of O(N^2).

After that, the program passes the vector to the CountSort method. 

Once both of those methods are finished, it prints their contents out.
